/**
 * Linkage data model.
 *
 * A node declares how it reacts to the form via a list of **rules**. Every rule
 * is a single {@link LinkageTrigger} paired with an ordered list of
 * {@link FieldLinkageAction}s — one uniform shape that subsumes both classic
 * "linkage" (a value condition drives a state change) and "events" (a field /
 * form moment drives a side effect). An event is simply a rule whose trigger is
 * an edge instead of a value condition.
 *
 * The model is intentionally recursive and orthogonal:
 *
 * - **Condition** is a discriminated union of three kinds — `leaf`, `group`,
 * `expression` — that compose freely. A leaf evaluates a single operator
 * against one source field; a group joins children with `all` / `any`
 * logic; an expression runs through the shared ZEN evaluator by default or a
 * host-supplied evaluator override.
 * - **Trigger** wraps a condition (a *level* signal) or names an *edge* — a
 * field event (`change` / `focus` / `blur` / `click`) or a form lifecycle
 * moment (`load` / `beforeSubmit` / `afterSubmit`).
 * - **Action** is one of two families: **state** actions (`show` / `hide` /
 * ... / `assign` / `script`) that derive a field's runtime state, and
 * **effect** actions (`alert` / `set_field` / ...) that fire side effects.
 *
 * The framework ships the JSON shape, recursion, and default runtime
 * evaluators. Expression evaluation, script evaluation, and side-effect
 * dispatch are still pluggable via {@link LinkageEvaluators} so hosts can swap
 * in their own expression engine, script sandbox, or effect runtime.
