 *
 * Only `condition`-triggered rules carrying a **state** action are counted: they
 * are the rules that make this field's hidden / disabled / required state — and
 * therefore its validation — depend on another field's value. Effect-only rules
 * and edge-triggered (event) rules add no keys; their work happens on the
 * effect lane, not in this field's validator.
 *
 * Expression conditions return no keys — the expression evaluator is opaque to
 * the framework. Authors using `expression` must trust the runtime to
 * re-evaluate on any value change.
